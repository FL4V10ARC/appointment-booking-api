## About

The **Appointment Booking API** simulates a real-world service scheduling system. The project was built focusing on backend best practices: JWT security, layered architecture, data validation and global exception handling.

---

## API Flow

```
Client
  │
  ▼
[JwtAuthenticationFilter] → validates Bearer token on every request
  │
  ▼
[SecurityConfig] → checks ROLE (CLIENT / ADMIN)
  │
  ├── POST /auth/**              → public (register, login)
  ├── POST /appointments         → CLIENT only
  ├── GET  /appointments/me      → CLIENT only
  ├── GET  /appointments         → ADMIN only
  └── DELETE /appointments/{id}  → CLIENT (own) | ADMIN (any)
  │
  ▼
Controller → Service → Repository → PostgreSQL
```
